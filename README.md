The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system
implementation  language for the nascent Unix operating system.   Derived from
the  typeless  language  BCPL,  it  evolved  a  type  structure;  created  on  a  tiny
machine as a tool to improve a meager programming environment, it has become
one of the dominant languages of today.  This paper studies its evolution.
